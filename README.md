### Full-Stack Engineer âš¡
I am currently working as an Full-Stack Engineer. I am passionate about Web Development, Machine Learning and Music. 

I want to document my learning process through my Github profile. I will be working on projects to build my skills and competencies in these key areas: 
-	Applied **machine learning** on a larger scale (Tensorflow, Pytorch, Scikit-Learn)
-	Full-stack **web development** (HTML, CSS, Javascipt, React, Angular, Node.js, C#, Django, Flask)
-	Big **data** / cloud engineering (GCP, AWS, Azure, Hadoop Stack, Docker, Kubernetes)
