### Algorithms, algorithms, and more algorithms! âš¡
I am currently working as an Algorithm Developement Engineer. I am passionate about Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Coding and Music. 

I want to document my learning process through my Github profile. I will be working on projects to build my skills and competencies in these key areas: 
-	Applied **machine learning** on a larger scale (Tensorflow, Pytorch)
-	Full-stack **web development** (HTML, CSS, Javascipt, React, Angular, Node.js, C#, Django)
-	Big **data** / cloud engineering (GCP, AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes)
